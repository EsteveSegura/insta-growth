## Installation

**NOTE**: NodeJS 10.13.0 or higher is required.

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/EsteveSegura/insta-growth.git

# change the working directory to insta-growth
$ cd insta-growth

# install NodeJS & npm if they are not installed

# install the requirements
$ npm install
```


## Configuration 
Before running the software we have to add a minimum configuration to our project so that it works correctly.

First we are going to create a file that contains our **username** and **password** in **instagram**, this file must be located at the **src folder** of our project and we must call it **.env**
``./src/.env``

``` env
IG_USERNAME=InstagramAccount   
IG_PASSWORD=InstagramPassword
```

And then we have to fine tune the options with which we want the application to interact with **instagram**. This file is located in the **src folder** and is called **config.json** we can edit it with the most appropriate options.

``` json
{
    "hashtags" : ["food","recipes","sushi"], //hashtags related to our account. 
    "maxFollows" : 1000, //maximum followers of our targets. 
    "maxMediaCount" : 450 //maximum media of our targets. 
}
```
## Usage
**Now we are ready to run the software**. Open two different terminals, we will execute two separate processes
``` bash
# Terminal 1
$ cd src
$ node server
```

```bash
# Terminal 2
$ cd src
$ node index
```

These two processes belong to a web interface and the system that connects directly to instagram. We can interact directly with the web interface by browsing directly at <a href="http: //localhost:5000">http://localhost:5000</a>
